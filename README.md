# human Ensemble Cell Atlas (hECA)
To fully use the separated massive data and speed up the building of cell references based on available data, we developed a system to collect and seamlessly integrate unorganized data scattered in the literature, and assemble them into a comprehensive transcriptional atlas of human cells. We name the system as human Ensemble Cell Atlas or hECA.
